Real Time Object Classification



### Brief:

This project is derived from DTU Physics Master Thesis by Lisa Aagensen. The initial goal was to not only speed up the process in acquiring images and processing these for data extraction, but also to work towards a real-time approach where images are acquired, analyzed while found objects are classified by a loaded ML model.



### Dependencies:

 - Boost
 - OpenCV
 - Qt
