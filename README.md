Real Time Object Classification



### Brief:

This project is derived from the master thesis by Lisa O. Aagensen, DTU Physics. The initial goal was to not only speed up the process in acquiring images and processing these images for data extraction, but also to work towards a real-time approach where images are acquired and analyzed while found objects are classified by a loaded ML model.
